Psychoanalysis is of little help, entertaining as it does the most intimate of relations with money, and recording\u2014while refusing to recognize it\u2014an entire system of economic-monetary dependences at the heart of the desire of every subject it treats. Psychoanalysis constitutes for its part a gigantic enterprise of absorption of surplus value. But which is the revolutionary path? Is there one?\u2014To withdraw from the world market, as Samir Amin advises Third World countries to do, in a curious revival of the fascist "economic solution"? Or might it be to go in the opposite direction? To go still further, that is, in the movement of the market, of decoding and deterritorialization? For perhaps the flows are not yet deterritorialized enough, not decoded enough, from the viewpoint of a theory and a practice of a highly schizophrenic character. Not to withdraw from the process, but to go further, to "accelerate the process," as Nietzsche put it: in this matter, the truth is that we havent seen anything yet.\''}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\u2014Deleuze and Guattari, Anti-Oedipus"})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.M)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}}}]);
